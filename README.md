# @iffyloop/build-cpython

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow to build any branch of [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython) for Windows or macOS. We aim to provide clean, standalone Python builds which may be embedded in other applications to provide a full-fledged Python environment without requiring a system-wide install.
